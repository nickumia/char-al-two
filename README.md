# char-al-two
Simple python script to print out characters that occur at least two times in an input string.

Task: Write an algorithm (choose the language you prefer) that given a character string, for instance {‘c’,’a’,’i’,’o’,’p’,’a’}, will print out the list of characters appearing at least 2 times. In this specific example, it would return {‘a’}. Afterwards, comment out the cost in terms of space and time.

Approach: Tally the characters in a dictionary and then check which entries have a frequency of at least two.
